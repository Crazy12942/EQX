# EQX
1. Even we can't get promoted, I still love this company but most of the staff are facing difficulty in money, some of the staff are having stage one or two with head hunter outside, will our salary get a bigger adjustment or still depends on global/APAC decision?

2. Looking forward to having the IBX FE exchange program, even divide to A/B team, the Gov will not because one of the team got COVID and another team no need to get isolate. If we got a FE to have a basic knowledge of another IBX, we can have that FE secondment to the IBX when the whole team needs to be isolated under Gov request.

3. Will our FE got a cell phone(Shared among LOCC) for SH purposes?  Currently, some of the customers are requesting to have Whatsapp/TG contact them while performing SH, to satisfy the customer, FE will use their personal number to contact the customer. Understand that we got JARVIS but some of the customers are still refused to use it. Actually, we only need a number to register Whatsapp/TG service because the IBX is surrounded by Wi-fi service already. Our team knows that SG1/2 has their own LOCC number for using WhatsApp communication with the customer, please kindly consider this.

4. Herd that the company direction is starting to call the customer with the general number 800-938-645, can we also able to config the IP phone at LOCC so our team can directly use it to call the customer?

5. Can we have more information about platform NEXT? We totally don't have a brief concept on that.

6. Glad to see more green plants and healthy drinks/snacks in the office.

7. The Gov is pushing the vaccine injection rate, will the company advise staff to take the vaccine as well? Will our operation staff got banned from work if they still didn't get the vaccine?

8. One of the FE123 promotion criteria are the innovative idea, however, this criteria already run for a long time, some of the FE are suffering in thinking of new idea. Can they choose not to present the innovative idea when they have a longer working experience plus a lower priority in the promotion list?

9. How come Senior FE4 removed the "Senior" in the title and renamed it into just an FE4? Is it global think that FE4 don't deserve "Senior"? On our side, seems it is the same meaning as "降grade".

10. Can we have a clear excel list for the role in ops-admin? In operation, sometimes we actually don't know which ops-admin we have to look for(facilitator/cleaning/expense).

11. Many FE are inputting fake data in Fong Hing just to show that their site is very busy, what data actually does fong hing want to get? Or just to monitor FE's performance?

12. Can we have a list of vendors with contact info, which subject they respond to, and also the budget code for reference? We want a more clear guideline.

13. Planner同Fong Hing都係mark 緊你嘅工作內容 既然係咁 可唔可以stop咗其中一樣? 依家個情況係 當我原本件事用5分鐘做得掂 但係依家就變咗10分鐘 因為有一半時候都用咗黎做input data依樣野, 變相多咗一倍workload. 同埋點解每次有增多同減少都要解釋，會唔會有一個空間係例如+-10%就無需要跟進？

14. 每條team都因爲點__樣list一個具體workload而煩，好多野係唔可以量化既，如果一個同事可以同時做2個case，但只可以入一個time log，呢個同事係咪唔做得野呢？對於公司黎講，每一個人係咪要100%workload先算正常？

15. 其實唔係個個site都真係夠人做到AB team依樣野 工作上要2-3個人做其實係好常見, smart hand 做equipment install要人手, NCC migration/de-install/smart hand 甩power 要double eyes, 我到底跟sop定AB team好?

16. 開IBX state黄色既定義係咩？
