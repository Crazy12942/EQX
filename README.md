# EQX
1. Even we can't get promoted, I still love this company but most of the staff are facing difficulty in money, some of the staff are having stage one or two with head hunter outside, will our salary get a bigger adjustment or still depends on global/APAC decision?

2. Looking forward to having the IBX FE exchange program, even divide to A/B team, the Gov will not because one of the team got COVID and another team no need to get isolate. If we got a FE to have a basic knowledge of another IBX, we can have that FE secondment to the IBX when the whole team needs to be isolated under Gov request.

3. Will our FE got a cell phone(Shared among LOCC) for SH purposes?  Currently, some of the customers are requesting to have Whatsapp/TG contact them while performing SH, to satisfy the customer, FE will use their personal number to contact the customer. Understand that we got JARVIS but some of the customers are still refused to use it. Actually, we only need a number to register Whatsapp/TG service because the IBX is surrounded by Wi-fi service already. Our team knows that SG1/2 has their own LOCC number for using WhatsApp communication with the customer, please kindly consider this.

4. Herd that the company direction is starting to call the customer with the general number 800-938-645, can we also able to config the IP phone at LOCC so our team can directly use it to call the customer?

5. Can we have more information about platform NEXT? We totally don't have a brief concept on that.

6. Glad to see more green plants and healthy drinks/snacks in the office.

7. The Gov is pushing the vaccine injection rate, will the company advise staff to take the vaccine as well? Will our operation staff got banned from work if they still didn't get the vaccine?

8. One of the FE123 promotion criteria are the innovative idea, however, this criteria already run for a long time, some of the FE are suffering in thinking of new idea. Can they choose not to present the innovative idea when they have a longer working experience plus a lower priority in the promotion list?
